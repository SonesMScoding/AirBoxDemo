This is not an ideal template because there are many assets that would be icons rather than images. The dots with icons in the feature section
would ideally be dots made with border radius styling and a centered icon. This applies to the footer dots as well, but for now
there are a couple of pngs used as placeholders for what a design team would typically provide. 

This was done quickly, as there was an instructional misunderstanding on my end.
